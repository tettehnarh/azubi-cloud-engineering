# Azubi Cloud Engineering

The Azubi Africa Cloud Engineering Program aims to impart the skills needed to build, deploy, and design successful cloud architecture and to grow into a resilient cloud engineer in the long run. The program is also tailored in such a way to accommodate people with limited IT experience who want to develop their existing knowledge in the field and explore cloud engineering as a career.

The program is divided into two phases: The Platform Agnosticâ€¯ and the Project Phase to prepare you adequately for a great life in tech.
